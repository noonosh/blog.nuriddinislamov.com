<b>I</b> have been always thinking of moving out of Uzbekistan. Now it’s done, I’m in the UK, Cambridge. Anglia Ruskin University - that’s the one I am gonna be studying at. Let me explain all that in <i>short</i>.

At the age of 5, I started primary school. It wasn't easy though. After finishing the first class, the other 3 years of my primary education and the first 2 years of secondary education were done in school #60. Then I transferred to the British School in Tashkent (BST), where I met a lot (believe me) of new friends. All of them were very kind, wise, and friendly to me when I first stepped into the class with zero knowledge of English. I wanna say huge thanks to every single person I met there and all the teachers - you were the most helpful and life-guiding in my early steps of adult life.

### 🙇‍♂️📚📑💔 2018-2020

These years speak up a lot about themselves. I better say that in 2018 I entered the Academic Lyceum of Westminster International University in Tashkent (ALWIUT) and studied there for 2 years. During this period, I confronted a wide range of different situations including happiness and sadness.

From the academic perspective, it was all OK.

### 💨🍃🎈 2020-2021

1 year at WIUT. Why? Idk. Just for fun. Yeah, it was fun. Although I can't say that I met as many friends there as I did in my previous institutions, I found really valuable ones. Yeah, [J](https://github.com/jakhongeer), that's about you.

### Now

Now I have chosen the university of "my taste" - [Anglia Ruskin University](https://aru.ac.uk). Had a flight on Sept. 14, and I really sorry (🙏😢) for those who didn't know about that. I literally had no time for myself during these last days before departure. After 8 hours of flight, 2,5 hours drive and 20 minutes walk with 2 huge luggages - oh, I am too tired - completed check in for my flat and entered. I really appreciate the help of Dina, my new friend, including pasta that she cooked for me right from the first couple of hours she met me. That was too cute ☺️. I am staying for 10 days in my room for self-isolation and have a bunch of free time. So there were thought of keeping up with all social media platforms. This includes YouTube, Twitter, Telegram channel, Instagram(probably). What do you think about that?

However, I'm really interested in YT ;)
