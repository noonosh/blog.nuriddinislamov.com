### 2020-2021 academic year has played a huge role for my future life.

This is not in the terms of that "WIUT helped me", but I got lessons that studying in Uzbekistan completely does not fit international standards and does not prepare **you** for global challenges.

[Westminster International University in Tashkent](http://wiut.uz) in the best university in the country and it **does help a lot** students who come from government schools. It provides a huge variety of courses.

However, I am leaving.
